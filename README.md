# Basics
Hi!

My name is Daniel, but I prefer Dan, and I'm a 20 year old Dev from Portugal.

I'm an aspiring Mobile Developer, currently certified in Kotlin and taking a course on Flutter, in order to go Multi-Platform!
<br>If you need help with Kotlin projects, I'm available!

# Projects
### OneTapHelp
I'm the developer behind '<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.qoding.otaphelp" target="_blank">OneTapHelp</a>', an Android app designed to serve as a "pocket-helper" of sorts, allowing the user to automatically request Police, Fire and Medical help to their current location, at the tap of a button.

### I'm Okay
I'm also behind '<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.qoding.iamokay" target="_blank">I'm Okay</a>', which is also an Android App (for now ðŸ˜‰), designed for people with Anxiety and/or Depression, providing relaxing sounds, in order to help them handle any crisis and/or episode.
In a future update, a new feature will be available - 'Zen' - designed to help people fall asleep more easily and in a more relaxed state, using sounds from TIDE.

### Woof
'Woof' is an unreleased app (for now), designed to be the World's best Social Network for your 4-legged friends - Doggos.
<br>A release date for 'Woof' hasn't been determined yet.
