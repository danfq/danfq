# Basics ![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=danfq&color=e91e63)
Hi!

My name is Daniel, but I prefer Dan, and I'm a 22 year old Dev from Portugal.

I'm a Mobile Developer, currently certified in Kotlin and Flutter.

# Work
I'm currently the IT Lead for an international company that I unfortunately can't yet name.
<br>I am, however, still open to any freelancing jobs that may require an extra hand - check <a href="#contact">Contact</a>.

# Projects
### I'm Okay
I'm the developer behind '<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.qoding.iamokay" target="_blank">I'm Okay</a>', which is also an Android App (for now ðŸ˜‰), designed for people with Anxiety and/or Depression, providing relaxing sounds, in order to help them handle any crisis and/or episode.
In a future update, a new feature will be available - 'Zen' - designed to help people fall asleep more easily and in a more relaxed state, using sounds from TIDE.
